# web-dna

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humphd/web-dna.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/humphd/web-dna)

This is an node.js, Express-based REST API for discovering the content type of URLs.

## Installation
```
$ npm install
```

## Configuration

The server is configured by setting environment variables. These settings include:

- `PORT` - The Port number to use for the server. Defaults to `8888`.
- `REDIS_URL`, `REDISCLOUD_URL`, or `REDISTOGO_URL` - The URL of the Redis server used for caching. Defaults to none.
- `MEMCACHED_URL` - The URL of the Memcached server used for caching. Defaults to none.
- `CACHE_EXPIRE` - The number of seconds to cache responses. Defaults to `3600` seconds (i.e., 1 hour).

## How to use
```
$ node server.js
```

## API

The web-dna server expects a URL in the following form:

    http://localhost:<PORT>/url/<url>

The server takes the URL and attempts to do two things. First, it gets the actual URL in the case that a URL shortener has been used, or other redirects. Second, it requests the HTTP headers for this resource, and determins the `content-type` that is being used. Both pieces of information are returned as JSON.

Assuming a web-dna server running on `http://localhost:8888`, the following are valid API calls:

### Example 1: simple url
```
http://localhost:8888/url/http://google.com

{
  "href": "http://www.google.ca/",
  "contentType": "text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
}
```

### Example 2: shortened url
```
http://localhost:8888/url/http://bit.ly/900913

{
  "href": "http://www.google.ca/",
  "contentType": "text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
}
```

### Example 3: image resource
```
http://localhost:8888/url/http://i.imgur.com/syPS3rG.jpg

{
  "href": "http://i.imgur.com/syPS3rG.jpg",
  "contentType": "image/jpeg"
}
```

### Example 4: video resource
```
http://localhost:8888/url/http://archive.org/download/PET1018_R-2_LA/PET1018_R-2_LA.mp4

{
  "href": "http://ia700805.us.archive.org/2/items/PET1018_R-2_LA/PET1018_R-2_LA.mp4",
  "contentType": "video/mp4"
}
```

## JSON vs. JSONP

If the caller provides a `callback=<callbackFn>` query string parameter, the result will be JSONP instead of pure JSON:
```
http://localhost:8888/url/http://google.com?callback=foo

foo && foo({
  "href": "http://www.google.ca/",
  "contentType": "text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
});
```

Note: if the URL being passed to the API also includes `?callback=...`, remember to encode the URL such that `?` becomes `%3F` and is not interpreted as part of the API call. Consider:
```
// URL with ?callback param used as part of API call (JSONP)
http://localhost:8888/url/http://foo.com?callback=bar

// URL containing ?callback param (not part of API call)
http://localhost:8888/url/http%3A%2F%2Ffoo.com%3Fcallback%3Dfn

// URL containing ?callback param with API using JSONP callback param bar
http://localhost:8888/url/http%3A%2F%2Ffoo.com%3Fcallback%3Dfn?callback=bar
```

## Errors

A number of situations can cause errors. In all such cases, the API will return a 500 result code, and JSON of the following form:

```
{
  "error": "Error message..."
}
```

Current errors include:

  - `Expected url param, found none.` -- no url was specified to the API call.
  - `Unable to determine content type.` -- the url was unusable, or the resource's content type could not be determined for some reason.

If no error message is given, an unknown error occurred.

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests locally by doing the following from the project's root directory:
```
$ npm test
```
The tests depend on a network connection being available (some real URLs are used).

In order to test the server's cache support, you have to run the tests with some extra environment variables. First, install and start `redis-server` and/or `memcached` locally, then run the tests like so:
```
$ EXPECT_CACHED=1 REDIS_URL=127.0.0.1 npm test
...
$ EXPECT_CACHED=1 MEMCACHED_URL=127.0.0.1 npm test
```
